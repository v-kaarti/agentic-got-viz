// Optional: Simplify some parts of the data for better visualization
// For example, you could reduce some of the deeper nested children
// or combine some nodes to create a more balanced tree

// For very wide trees, you might want to change the treeLayout in tree.js to:
// this.treeLayout = d3.tree()
//     .nodeSize([80, 100]) // Fixed node size instead of overall dimensions
//     .separation((a, b) => a.parent === b.parent ? 1.2 : 2);
